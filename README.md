# *Zipf’s Law for Speech Acts in Spoken English*
This dataset is used in our paper *Zipf’s Law for Speech Acts in Spoken English*.


This repository includes: 
  1. the speech act (SA) frequency of each gender/education group (taking speakers as the units of analysis and dialogs as the units of analysis, respectively),
  2. the dialogs' fitting results of the Zipf distribution, which is in the format of six columns: Dialog No. | Gender Group | Education Group | a | b | R^2 | RMSE | MAE,
  3. the interlocutors' fitting results of the Zipf distribution, which is also in the format of six columns: Speaker No. | Gender Group | Education Group | a | b | R^2 | RMSE | MAE.


**Note:** The groups with insufficient cases for statistical analysis have been removed from the dataset.
